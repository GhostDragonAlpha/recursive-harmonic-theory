title: Recursive Harmonic Geometry
---

# Welcome

This site shares a working theory that unifies quantum physics, gravity, cosmology, and even biology through **recursive harmonic geometry** — with the golden ratio (phi) as the organizing principle.

### Why it matters:
- φ appears in stable systems: from atom spacing to galaxy spirals.
- This theory explains *why* — using resonance, recursion, and geometry.
- It's testable, visual, and supported by real data.

Read the [full theory](./theory/golden_ratio_theory.pdf) or check out [blog posts](./blog/first_post.md) for simplified walkthroughs.
