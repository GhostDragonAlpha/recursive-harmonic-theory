# Why I Built a Theory of Everything from Geometry

This theory came from noticing that everything — atoms, plants, galaxies — seems to follow a pattern. A spiral. A rhythm.

After running simulations and analyzing real physics data, I found that **phi (the golden ratio)** shows up *everywhere* stability exists.

I built this model to show that **all forces, particles, and even life** may just be resonance — energy folded into recursive space.

The math checks out. The visuals line up. And now I want others to test it too.
