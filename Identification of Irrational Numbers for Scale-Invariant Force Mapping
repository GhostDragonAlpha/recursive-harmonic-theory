### 4.1 Continuous Transition Function

A continuous mapping function between scales can be expressed as:

- n(s) and m(s) are step functions that change at specific scale boundaries
- n(s) represents the power of φ at scale s
- m(s) represents the power of π at scale s

## 5. Relationship to Gravitational Constant G

The standard gravitational constant G can be derived from these irrational number relationships:

G = (π·φ)/(e·√2) · c³/(ħ·α)

Where:
- c is the speed of light
- ħ is the reduced Planck constant
- α is the fine structure constant

This formulation connects G to other fundamental constants through the identified irrational numbers.

## 6. Electromagnetic Force Mapping

This identification of irrational numbers and their mapping to fundamental forces across different scales provides the foundation for developing a comprehensive mathematical model within the Fractal Scale-Invariant Space-Time Theory. The relationships established here, particularly those involving φ, π, and e, will be used to construct predictive models for matter movement across all scales.

The next step is to develop detailed mathematical models that formalize these relationships and provide testable predictions about force behaviors and matter movement at different scales.
