# Recursive Harmonic Geometry: A Unified Theory of Everything

This project explores a unified model of physical, cosmic, and biological phenomena using recursive harmonic geometry based on the golden ratio (phi ≈ 1.618). The theory proposes that space, energy, and structure are organized by recursive curvature and standing wave resonance, emerging naturally across all scales — from atoms to galaxies to life.

### What's Included:
- A complete PDF of the theory
- Visual slides and simulations
- Blog entries explaining concepts for non-experts
- Source code for harmonic field and wave simulations

Explore the spiral behind reality.
