# Recursive Harmonic Geometry: A Unified Theory of Everything

This project explores a unified model of physical, cosmic, and biological phenomena using recursive harmonic geometry based on the golden ratio (phi ≈ 1.618). The theory proposes that space, energy, and structure are organized by recursive curvature and standing wave resonance, emerging naturally across all scales — from atoms to galaxies to life.
